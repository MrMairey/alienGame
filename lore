UFO dude is on an expedition to an unknown universe, as his interdimensional
 transport device sends him through the wormhole he is greeted with a peculiar sight.
 the creatures here are lacking the very foundation of life in his universe:
 CURVES!
 shocked by this discovery he begins taking measurements and images with his beams
 of green light. As he gets closer he begins to suspect that these red pointy
 creatures may be hostile and decides to avoid contact for his own safety.
 (lets ignore the plothole that his beams are pointy)
